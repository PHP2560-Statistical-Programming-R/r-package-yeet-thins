ProvidR makes it easy to 
-examine providers by type (taxonomy)
-explore provider density by state
-explore numbers of providers by zip code 

NumProviderInZip() to show the number of providers in a single zip code for a certain taxonomy
NumProviderInCounty() to show the number of providers in a single county for a certain taxonomy
