## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#zip codes for state
data(zipcode)

#takes a value for state and returns all the zipcodes from the state
zips_from_state<-function(state_name){
  zip_holder<-zipcode%>%
    filter(state==state_name)%>%
    select(zip)
  zip_state<-zip_holder[,1]
  return(zip_state)
}
zip.ri<-zips_from_state("RI")
zip.ca<-zips_from_state("CA")
zip.nd<-zips_from_state("ND")

```

```{r}
#takes a city name and returns all the zipcodes from the city
zips_from_city<-function(city_name){
    zip_holder<-zipcode%>%
    filter(city==city_name)%>%
    select(zip)
  zip_city<-zip_holder[,1]
  return(zip_city)
}

zip.pvd<-zips_from_city("Providence")
zips.wantagh<-zips_from_city("Wantagh")

```

```{r}

NPIcode<-function(zipcode, providertype){
