##Census join completed
On 11/29/2018, at 1:59pm, Jackie successfully joined the provider data set to a linking data set to census data. She feels victorious


##what we have done
Meghan wrote code over the weekend that makes a provider density function by state, but NPI doesnt have states
Alex calls from Zipcodes in a given state, if you want to take zip codes and call out state
Also if put in location, it puts out a data frame
Jackie's function using the provider taxonomy and zipcode, to the census data
but gives you county at each row

##What we hope the function does
Our function should provide output at the county level, looking at provider density per county and per state.

##what do we still need to do
We want to be able to have it so that people can put in state or zip and taxonomy and get provider density
and get visualization, also maybe maping 

##other kinds of visualizations
use some of the graphs from project for this

##random cool shit we might aim for
Maps, maps, maps


##Roles as of 11/30/2018
Alex: visualization function
Jackie:Compiling package
Kari: Maps with Meghan and overall assisting and debug help
Meghan: provider density functions
