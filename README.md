# r-package-yeet-thins

Our package will scrape web data from the United States NPI registry to allow for researchers to more efficiently determine health coverage among geographical regions. We will map addresses from the NPI registry and compare them alongside census tracts to understand how providers are allocated per region, mapping counties from address. We will create functions that will allow for researchers to input 1) a provider specialty, or specialties and 2) a geographic location. In return they will receive output with details on coverage statistics and lists of provider names of locations. It will also allow input of social determinants of interest. We will also create visualizations. 

Responsibilities:
Kari & Jackie: work on mapping census data alongside geographic regions, scrape population-level data 
Meghan: Amend code from the previous project to write to code that is divided by provider specialities. 
Alex: Create visualizations showing provider coverage
